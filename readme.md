# Python Image Recognition Program
> This project is make for image recognition using python and opencv, this project is still in development and will be updated soon.


Hi!
I developed this project to learn and test some things in python, mainly the graphical interfaces and openCV, I intend to one day update it to some other cool functions involving controlling the movement of a tripod automatically.
I accept any suggestion on how to improve my code.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the requirements:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/renan-dias/PyImageRecognition.git
```

Move to directory and run the program:

```sh
cd /PyImageRecognition
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install opencv-python
```
```sh
pip install tkinter
```

## Usage example

This is a study project so I can learn to apply OpenCv and Tkinker with Python.

## Release History

* 0.0.1
    * CHANGE: Update docs and project to github (start of development)

## Coming Soon

I intend to create an executable that will open a screen and recognize the object being viewed and categorize it, using the tensorflow library.
